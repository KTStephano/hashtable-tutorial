# hashtable-tutorial

A tutorial set using C++ is under works and will be up soon.

## How to use this tutorial
Inside of java/src you will find 7 class files each named "Tutorial0#.java" where # is the tutorial number. In order to follow along, I recommend you start at number 1 and move from there.

Each tutorial contains complete source code for everything done so far, as well as some test code inside of main(). To get the full amount out of each one, you should read all the comments (there are a LOT of comments!) and try to implement the code on your own starting from a blank slate, making changes along the way. Copy + pasting it without changing things around or just reading it probably won't do a whole lot for you.

To help you out, almost every tutorial has an "Excercises" section inside of the comment block at the top of the file. These exercises will give you suggestions for things you can try before moving on, including things that this tutorial doesn't touch on.

## What this tutorial includes
If you follow this from start to end, you will have a hash table implementation that supports operations such as:

* put() - enter new elements into the hash table
* containsKey() - check if a key exists in the table
* remove() - removes a key-value pair from the table if it exists
* size() - reports the size of the table
* capacity() - reports the maximum capacity of the table at the current time

Along with this, you will also be able to iterate over your hash table using range-for syntax.
